# InjectorWIZARD

InjectorWIZARD is a MATLAB-based tool for designing rocket engine injectors. It supports all major injector types including coaxial swirl and jet configurations, pintle variants, and impinging designs.

The prototype software also includes swirl injector dynamics, combustion chamber resonance, and pattern design calculations. It was developed to streamline early-stage injector architecture selection and accelerate design iteration. 

## Getting Started

To use the software:

1. Download `InjectorWIZARD_Installer.exe`
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions

## Development Status

InjectorWIZARD is an actively evolving prototype. The executable is regularly updated with incremental improvements, bug fixes, and new features. As such, functionality may change between releases. Users are encouraged to check back often for the latest version.
