# InjectorWIZARD

InjectorWIZARD is a MATLAB-based tool for designing rocket engine injectors. It supports all major injector types including coaxial swirl and jet configurations, pintle variants, and impinging designs.

The prototype software also includes swirl injector dynamics and combustion chamber resonance calculations. It was developed to streamline early-stage injector architecture selection and accelerate design iteration.
